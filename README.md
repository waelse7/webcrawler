This project was completed as a guided project from boot.dev. I do not take full credit for this project, as it was done with guided assistance.


# webcrawler

In this project, we'll be building a Web Crawler in JavaScript using Node.js! To rank well in Google Search, websites need to internally link pages one to another. For example, my blog post about the benefits of cheap haircuts should probably have a link to my other blog post about the best places to get haircuts.

We're going to write a JavaScript application that generates an "internal links" report for any website on the internet by crawling each page of the site.
